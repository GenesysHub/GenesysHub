## What I'm Building

I'm building a modular ecosystem designed to create, manage, and orchestrate tools, workflows, and applications; whether for the web or local environments. The platform is structured to be composable, extensible, and user-friendly, enabling full control without reliance on third parties.

### Core Components

* **Frontend - App Hub**
  A Next.js-based interface that serves as an app hub, where users can launch and interact with modular apps. These apps can be custom-built or community-driven, and some are already integrated by default:

  * **System App** - for managing diagrams, layout components, and core framework settings
  * **Server App** - for interacting with backend logic: managing tools, running workflows, accessing data, etc.

* **Backend - Execution & Orchestration**
  A flexible backend runtime that handles the logic and execution layer:

  * Create, run, and retrieve data from tools, presets, and agents
  * Expose dynamic server endpoints for frontend access
  * Automatically map available tools, presets, and resources for easy integration

* **Packages & Architecture**
  The system is orchestrated through a series of modular packages. While some are currently closed-source during development, the long-term goal is full open-sourcing. Each package is designed to be clean, reusable, and easy to build on.

### The Broader Vision

This project is not just a tool, a framework, or a UI. it's an ecosystem built to empower creators, developers, and teams. The platform is designed as a base layer that makes it easy to build applications and workflows in a testable, deployable, and extensible way, without needing to rely on third-party platforms or proprietary systems.

The goal is to create a space where users can work independently:

* Build tools, apps, and workflows through an intuitive interface
* Share or reuse components through a growing library of open-source modules
* Extend functionality using third-party APIs and services
* Enable businesses to foster developer communities that contribute apps and workflows, accelerating onboarding and internal innovation

By lowering the barrier to build and orchestrate systems, this platform aims to become a foundation for open, developer-driven business logic, supporting both individual creators and teams looking to scale custom internal tools or public-facing apps.

## About Me

Long-time tech builder and early crypto miner (since Ethereum PoW days). Deeply aligned with the Cypherpunk manifesto. I value privacy, decentralization, and open-source software above all. I consider Monero (XMR) to be the only real cryptocurrency; private, permissionless, and aligned with the original vision of digital cash.

I primarily develop in **TypeScript**, building modern, modular systems using **Node.js**, **Next.js**, and a range of open, composable tools. My interests aim at the intersection of **AI**, **developer experience**, and **sovereign computing**.

## Technical Focus

### Languages & Frameworks

* Language: **TypeScript**
* Frontend: **React**, **Next.js** (with a strong preference for **observable-based state** systems over traditional React state)
* Backend: **Node.js**, custom server runtimes

### Web3 Development

* Comfortable writing simple **Solidity** contracts
* Experienced in building frontend experiences for blockchain interactions using:

  * wagmi
  * viem
* Focused on building meaningful, user-facing integrations with EVM-based networks

### AI & Tooling Systems

I'm actively working on toolchains and architectures that support:

* Dynamic **agent execution**, **tool coordination**, and **workflow composition**
* Use of **OpenAI SDK & APIs** for agents and tool orchestration
* Integration of **open-source/self-hosted models** including:

  * Ollama
  * LM Studio
  * Hugging Face

I enjoy experimenting with different models, tools, and hybrid environments that allow more control, flexibility, and creativity than commercial APIs alone.

### General Stack Preferences

* Editor: VS Code
* Package Management: npm / pnpm
* Open-source libraries I often use:

  * **bun**
  * **legendapp**
  * **Mantine UI**
  * **Shadcn**
  * **Tailwind**
  * **React**
  * **Next**

## Personal Philosophy

There are tools and approaches I love and others I intentionally avoid.

### I Like

* Open systems over black boxes
* Self-hosted, controllable stacks
* Building tools that solve real problems
* Projects and libraries that are designed to be composed, not locked in

I don’t build for money. I build because something in me needs to. When I’m fully focused and connected to what I’m creating, I move faster, think deeper, and learn more. That level of immersion creates results no “just doing the job” mindset can reach. That’s where the real value is. Everything else is noise.

### I Don't Like

* Python (as a language and ecosystem)
* Centralized cryptocurrencies
* Closed-source projects with no intention to open up
* Influencers who talk tech but never build
* Unnecessary meetings, calls, or interactions
* Cold outreach without clear intent or value

I’m intentional about my focus and interactions. I filter communication heavily (online and offline) to reduce noise and prioritize wellness and deep work.
